# HTML-Front-End-w-Bootstrap

------------------
Description
------------------
Static-Front End Page designs made with BootStrap as the front end framework with no back-end support. 

This was my first attempt at HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap in a project to make a fake video streaming service as part of a larger group in a Software Engineering course at Cal Poly Pomona. I worked as the Front-End developer for the team although I had no prior experience in the aforementioned technologies.

Shortcomings and what I learned
--------------------------------
By no means do my pages look as professional as the sites I tried to imitate and took inspiration from, i.e Netflix, YouTube, Twitch, GoGoAnime, etc. This was my first time attempting any form of front-end design and had no formal learning or guide on the topic. Everything was self taught and researched over the span of 3 months. As such, I made some blunders along the way because I had no one to tell me what I was doing was wrong. 

For one, initially I created a single style sheet to work with all my pages, which was a nightmare, and I later managed to separate them all. I also didn't take advantage of all of bootstraps features because I simply did not know about them until halfway through, which is when I started implementing dynamic scaling with zoom to my newer pages. I didn't go back to add dynamic zoom to some other pages, so there are some inconsistencies across several pages. 

Some of the designs I made were scrapped by my team and ultimately never made it into our final "fake product", but I've uploaded them here.
